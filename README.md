Allows players to create a **not-wandering**, **faster**, **smaller** Happy Ghast and even **summon** it back in survival using items.

> Makes the Happy Ghast usable again while staying balanced and survival-friendly.

## Installation

After adding the data pack/mod to your world or server, you should be able to open the about panel, which is fully controllable with the mouse:

```mcfunction
/function improved_happy_ghast:about
```
